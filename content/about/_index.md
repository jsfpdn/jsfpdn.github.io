I'm a computer science student at Masaryk University doing my master's in theoretical computer science.
I've received bachelor's in mathematical computer science.
I focus on **compilers**, **parallel programming**, **distributed systems**, **functional programming** and
**algorithm & data structure design**. I write code mainly in **Go**, **Rust** and **Zig**.

You can reach me at jsfpdn at gmail dot com, on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsfpdn)

Some things I am (or was) working on:

- [Regatta](https://engineering.jamf.com/regatta/) -- helping out with the development of a globally distributed key-value database for the edge
  ([source code](https://github.com/jamf/regatta), [helm chart](https://engineering.jamf.com/regatta/))
- [MH-Tree](https://gitlab.fi.muni.cz/disa/public/hulls/mh-tree) -- similarity search index structure in metric spaces
  which was the main focus of my [bachelor's thesis](https://is.muni.cz/th/iwjhs/josef_podany_bachelors_thesis.pdf)
- [yatlc](https://github.com/jsfpdn/yatlc) -- toy compiler backed by LLVM for a small imperative language
- Feedforward neural network [recognizing handwritten digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)
  with 89% accuracy. Written in Rust from scratch with no dependencies
