I'm a computer science student at Masaryk University doing my master's in theoretical computer science.
I'm currently diving deeper into complexity theory, algorithm design, compilers, distributed systems,
and functional programming.

Programming mainly in Go and Rust, sometimes in Zig and C++.

Visit [_links_](../links) to see what I'm currently reading.

You can reach me at jsfpdn at gmail dot com, on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsfpdn)
or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josef-podany/).

Some things I am (or was) working on:

- Regatta -- helping out with the development of a globally distributed key-value database for the edge.
  ([source](https://github.com/jamf/regatta), [docs](https://engineering.jamf.com/regatta/),
  [helm chart](https://engineering.jamf.com/regatta/))
- [MH-Tree](https://gitlab.fi.muni.cz/disa/public/hulls/mh-tree) -- similarity search index structure in metric spaces
  ([bachelor's thesis](https://is.muni.cz/th/iwjhs/josef_podany_bachelors_thesis.pdf)).
- [yatlc](https://github.com/jsfpdn/yatlc) -- toy compiler written in Zig backed by LLVM.
- Multilayer perceptron neural network. Written in Rust from scratch with zero dependencies.

Some of my presentations:

- [Compile-Time Function Evaluation](/static/ctfe.pdf) -- how compile-time function evaluation can be implemented
  in a compiler, examples in C++ and Zig.
- [Dynamicity of MH-Trees](/static/mh_tree_extended.pdf) (or a [shorter version](/static/mh_tree.pdf)) --
  presentation for my bachelor's thesis defence.
- [Introduction to fuzz testing in Go](/static/fuzz_testing.pdf).
- [How to write linters in Go](/static/linters.pdf).
- [Pebble: LSM-Based Storage in Go](/static/pebble_lsm.pdf)
